 * ANSI/ISO C99 requires assert() to write to stderr.  This means that
 * writing to STDERR_FILENO is insufficient, as the user could freopen
 * stderr.  It is also insufficient to output to fileno(stderr) since
 * this would fail in the custom stream case.  I didn't remove the
 * old code though, as it doesn't use stdio stream functionality
 * and is useful in debugging the stdio code.
